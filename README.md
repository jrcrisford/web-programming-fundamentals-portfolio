This is the folder structure for your portfolio, containing your work in the tutorials and journal. You will need to add a top-level `index.html` (or, if you clone the repository directly into your individual webspace on ictteach-usermin, amend the auto-generated `index.html` there) to provide an index to your work.

You can delete this file if you wish.
