    <h2 id="week1">Week 1/Week 2 Introduction and HTML</h2>

    <h3>Summary of New Skills</h3>
    <p>
        The unit started with an introduction to the web and HTML, learning about some of its history and its significance in regard to the modern internet.
        I learned what a markup language is and how it is distinct from a programming language, and how browsers parse markup to render content in a browser window.
    </p>
    <p>
        We looked at the basic anatomy (syntax) of HTML elements and more specifically at HTML5 semantic elements such as 
        <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> discovering their functions and relevance.
        We also explored attributes and why they might be necessary, and how an HTML document should be structured overall.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, I learnt about basic form elements (e.g., <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>) and the required attribute for simple form validation.
        The tutorial task included creating multiple pages (index.html and registration.html), linking them, and ensuring that both share consistent headers and footers.
    </p>

    <h3>Tutorial Task and Self-Assessment</h3>
    <p>
        For the tutorial, I completed two basic HTML pages, index.html and registration.html. Both pages were structured using HTML elements and included the same headers and footers across both.
        The pages were linked for navigation, and the registration page included a form that had input fields, selections, checkboxes, and validation attributes.
        I met some minor difficulties, such as attribute typos and validation errors, but these issues were fairly easily resolved through checking and corrections.
    </p>
    <p>
        After completing this week's content and tutorial activities, I feel more confident in my understanding of HTML and ability to structure HTML pages semantically.
        My understanding of form elements and attributes has significantly improved.
        However, I sometimes remain uncertain about the correct placement of some attributes and the semantic relationships between elements, this can often be overcome by revisiting the content or googling my issue,
        besides this there was little else that I struggled with this week.
        Overall, my confidence with HTML has increased, and I feel comfortable creating basic HTML documents independently.
    </p>

    <h2 id="week3">Week 3 CSS</h2>

    <h3>Summary of New Skills</h3>
    <p>
        This week approached the concept of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which I learnt is used to style and visually format webpages.
        It was explained that CCS is only responsible for these visual elements and therefore must be paired with a markup language file such as HTML.
        I discovered how CSS changes elements in through selectors, including selecting by type, class, and/or ID.
        We were also taught about more advanced selectors such as attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements.
        Combinators were introduced, which select elements based on their relationship in the HTML structure.
        Fundamental CSS properties like fonts, colours, and margins were covered as well.
        The importance of organising CSS clearly for readability and maintainability was highlighted.
    </p>

    <h3>Tutorial Task</h3>
    <p>
        This week's tutorial involved applying the new CSS techniques to style the HTML pages created previously.
        The styling undertaken included centring page content within a container, adding background colours, and styling page elements such as headings, links, and buttons.
        and structuring the registration form neatly into two columns using CSS Grid allowing the labels and input fields to be better aligned.
        I encountered several issues during the process, particularly with the grid structure on the registration page, but these were mostly resolved through troubleshooting.
    </p>

    <h3>Self-Assessment</h3>
    <p>
        I feel I've learnt a lot from this week's content, particularly through the tutorial activity.
        I found the CSS concepts presented in the lectures and self-study materials to be confusing, as they felt quite different from the programming concepts I'm familiar with.
        However, actively working through the tutorial tasks made everything feel clearer, and it all began to fall into place.
        My confidence in applying CSS has significantly improved and I feel comfortable styling HTML element independently, although there are still some aspects that challenge me.
    </p>

    <h3>What Was Most Confusing</h3>
    <p>
        I particularly struggled with aspects of the CSS Grid layout.
        During the tutorial, I couldn’t get the columns to arrange and lay out in the way that I intended.
        Through trial and error, I discovered there are different justify-* properties, and using justify-content instead of justify-items gave me a result closest to what I wanted.
        Despite spending time trying to understand it, I still don’t fully get why this made such a difference.
        I also have no idea about more advanced pseudo-classes and especially pseudo-elements, although these weren't required for the tutorial.
        Maybe these will be revisited in the future.
    </p>

    <h2 id="week4">Week 4 UX & Accessibility</h2>

    <h3>Summary of New Skills</h3>
    <p>
        This week further built on my knowledge of CSS by introducing responsive design, specifically learning about media queries and the Flexbox layout system.
        This taught me ways to make pages adapt to different screen sizes by adjusting layouts and style, making websites more usable on mobile devices.
        In addition, User Experience (UX) principles were introduced focusing on design, navigation, and hierarchy.
        Accessibility (A11Y) was also introduced in which we learnt about practices such as using semantic HTML, colour contrast principles, and adding labels to improve the experience for less able users.
    </p>

    <h3>Tutorial Task</h3>
    <p>
        The tutorial task looked at making the marathon website more responsive and fit better on smaller screens (such as mobiles).
        Both the current pages were updated to include the viewport meta tag as well as having media queries added to adjust styles based on screen size.
        I also restructured the registration form layout for small screens by modifying the existing CSS Grid setup.
        I created a new testimonials page which included Flexbox to arrange the content in a flexible and hopefully responsive layout.
        Overall, this activity provided an opportunity to practise responsive design techniques and highlighted the importance of accessibility in layout design.
    </p>

    <h3>Self-Assessment and Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        I found this week’s content relatively easy to understand and straightforward.
        Perhaps worth mentioning that adding the viewport meta tag and working with media queries was conceptually new to me and was a little confusing to begin with but after experimenting a little bit it made sense quickly.
        Using Flexbox to structure the testimonials page was simple and intuitive after carefully reading the task instructions as was restructuring the CSS Grid for smaller screen.
        It felt that this week was more about reinforcing existing concepts rather than approaching anything particularly new and difficult.
    </p>

    <h2 id="week5">Week 5 Introducing JavaScript</h2>

    <h3>Summary of New Skills</h3>
    <p>
        This week’s content introduces JavaScript and the third core web technology taught in the unit.
        I learned how to allow a script to interact with a webpage using the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag and the importance of the <code>defer</code> attribute in forcing scripts to run after the page has loaded, and why this is important.
        Basic JavaScript syntax was introduced, including declaring variables, common data types, and control structures.
        I also learned how to use template literals to simplify string formatting.
        Functions and scoping rules were introduced such as hoisting and the differences between global, function, and block scope.
        Finally, basic debugging tools were mentioned along with the browser's developer tools to test and debug scripts.
    </p>

    <h3>Tutorial Task</h3>
    <p>
        The tutorial involved several small JavaScript activities.
        I connected a script file to an HTML page and used <code>consol.log()</code> to test functionality.
        The first activity involved calculating averages and comparing values using functions and conditional statements.
        I used <code>for</code> loops to iterate through arrays and objects which demonstrated the different types of data structures in JavaScript.
        There was the tax calculator task, this involved using conditionals to apply different tax brackets and template literals to format string outputs.
        I also wrote a function that injects content into the webpage using <code>innerHTML</code>, showing how JavaScript interacts with the DOM.
        All tasks helped me to better understand how JavaScript works alongside HTML.
    </p>

    <h3>Self-Assessment and Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        This week’s content was quite engaging and felt more familiar to me than other weeks.
        Given previous experience with programming units and languages, JavaScript feels more like what I’m used to, given it’s a true programming language rather than a markup or styling language like the others so far in the unit.
        The syntax, use of variables, functions, and control structures all felt intuitive and similar to concepts I’ve seen before.
        Learning about functions to process data and interact with the page was useful as it helped me understand how logic and layout can come together.
        I did find some parts like scoping rules and loop variations tricky to understand at first, but they quickly made more sense after using them in the tutorial.
        At this stage I’m feeling confident using JavaScript for page interaction and logic and feel comfortable with building on this in the coming weeks.
    </p>

    <h2 id="week6">Week 6 The Document Object Model</h2>

    <h3>Summary of New Skills</h3>
    <p>
        This week introduced the Document Object Model (DOM) which presents a webpage as a tree of elements that scripts, in this case JavaScript, can interact with.
        I learned how to use DOM methods like <code>getElementByID</code>, or <code>querySelector</code>, to select and change HTML elements.
        Events were also introduced, specifically how to use <code>addEventListener</code> to respond to user actions.
        The content also demonstrated basics of event propagation and how JavaScript can be used to validate forms dynamically.
    </p>

    <h3>Tutorial Task</h3>
    <p>
        The tutorial focused on using JavaScript to interact with the DOM to implement form validation.
        I removed the default HTML5 validation and implemented a <code>validateForm()</code> function instead.
        This function checked for required fields, compared password values, and showed error messages where relevant next to each input field.
        This approach used <code>addEventListener</code> to listen for the form submission and then dynamically modify the HTML page based on the received values.
        I used <code>classList</code> for applying styling from the CSS file which kept the presentation of the page separate from the validation logic.
        This task was a demonstration of how JavaScript can be utilised to control webpage behaviour and logic in a more flexible way than built-in methods.
    </p>

    <h3>Self-Assessment and Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        I initially found the content this week quite understandable and approachable, but the tutorial task presented a few challenges.
        I began the tutorial by trying to use <code>setCustomValidity()</code> and <code>reportValidity()</code> to display validation error, but after discussing with my tutor,
        I learned that while this method did indeed validate the fields correctly, the error messages didn’t present in a satisfactory way.
        Instead, I changed my approach to displaying error messages next to each form field manually using added <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements.
        This made the validation presentation clearer but required a restructuring of the JavaScript.
        I also had some issue with grid layout but the fix for this was simple and resulted in furthering my knowledge of the grid system.
        As a result of these setbacks, however, I feel more confident and believe my understanding of JavaScript and DOM manipulation has improved.
        I also have a greater appreciation of the importance of separating presentation from logic.
    </p>

    <h2 id="assignment1">Assignment 1 Reflection: Blog Frontend Development</h2>
    <p>
        While creating Assignment 1, I found it really interesting how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all work together to bring a website to life.
        Although this had been demonstrated during the weekly tutorial tasks, it was cool to see how the basic layout of the blog in HTML could be completely transformed by styling in CSS, and then made interactive through JavaScript.
        I especially liked implementing the JavaScript for form validation, JS is similar enough to other languages I am familiar with that it felt comfortable to code with, and it was very satisfying to get it all working smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also realised how much control CSS gives you over layout and design.
        We’d used CSS in the tutorial site, but that seems to have just scratched the surface of what’s possible.
        The transformation that occurred when a group member started doing the bulk of the styling was impressive and well worth the effort,
        it made the pages attractive and feel clean and responsive.
        JavaScript was also helpful for adding small interactive features, and I can see how open ended the possibilities are with it, given it’s essentially a traditional programming language.
        Creating button effects and hiding/showing elements, although basic, felt like a good introduction to this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I came away with a better appreciation of how front-end development is a mix of structure, design, content, and logic all working together.
        The assignment was, without a doubt, challenging at times, especially when factoring in the challenges of groupwork,
        but the project helped me build confidence in writing and troubleshooting code across all three languages.
        I’m really happy how the blog turned out, and it feels like the stress and time investment invested in the project was absolutely worth it.
    </p>

    <h2 id="week8">Week 8 Data Storage</h2>

    <h3>Summary of new skills</h3>
    <p>
        This week focused on how web applications store and manage data using data bases, it particularly focused on the relation model.
        We covered how to design and interpret Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), convert ERDs into data dictionaries, primary and foreign keys, and how they define relationships between tables.
        This has been covered fairly extensively in previous units, so there wasn’t much new to learn here, but it was a useful refresher and an opportunity to apply these concepts in a real-world scenario.
    </p>

    <h3>Tutorial Task</h3>
    <p>
        The tutorial involved designing a data base for the marathon website.
        I started by creating an ERD showing the employees, races, and participant entities, as well as an associative entity to track participants in races.
        Using the ERD I then created a data dictionary with defined attribute types and constraints.
        I think implemented the database design using phpMyAdmin and build to actual database.
        Creating the tables was simple but I had some trouble with adding the foreign key constraints to the associative entity.
        I eventually figured it out and inspected the result in the Designer view.
    </p>

    <h3>Self-Assessment and Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        This new knowledge clearly is intended to build on the earlier work with forms.
        Designing the ERD felt familiar and logical, and building the table in phpMyAdmin wasn’t particularly difficult other than some minor issues that were easily overcome.
        These issues mostly came from my unfamiliarity with the interface as most of my previous work with phpMyAdmin was directly writing SQL and importing it.
        This week served as a good refresher or planning and implementing databases from scratch, a skill I can see being useful in many facets of ICT.
    </p>

    <h2 id="week9">Week 9 PHP</h2>

    <h3>Summary of New Skills</h3>
    <p>
        This week introduced PHP, a server-side language for dynamic web content.
        I learnt about how PHP can be embedded within HTML using <code>&lt;?php ?&gt;</code> tags and how the server executes PHP before sending the resulting HTML to the browser.
        Basic syntax, carriable, control structures, and how it handles arrays and associative arrays was covered.
        Differences from JavaScript, like type juggling and scoping, were also discussed.
        Common PHP usage patterns including string formatting with <code>echo</code>, basic form handling, and accessing <code>$_GET</code> and <code>$_POST</code> variables where introduced.
    </p>

    <h3>Tutorial Task</h3>
    <p>
        The tutorial involved modifying a .php page that processed and displayed match data and tax calculations.
        I made PHP functions to calculate averages, count wins from arrays, and calculate taxes.
        Values were printed dynamically using <code>echo</code> within the HTML page.
        The tax calculator used associative arrays and formatted string values for clean output.
        The tutorial clarified how server-side code can be used to achieve logic driven pages that respond to data inputs.
    </p>

    <h3>Self-Assessment and Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        I found the content this week reasonably straightforward, especially because PHP shares a lot of syntax with other languages I’m familiar with.
        I did encounter the usual small issues like variable name typos and forgetting semicolons, which I noticed was particularly hard to spot in PHP for some reason.
        The immediate feedback when running the PHP in browser was appreciated, and I found the tutorial a helpful overall intro into basic server-side logic.
        Overall, I’m feeling more confident about using PHP to process data and generate dynamic output.
        Exploring the more advanced features in coming weeks should be interesting.
    </p>

    <h2 id="week10">Week 10 Dynamic Pages</h2>

    <h3>Summary of New Skills</h3>
    <p>
        The focus this week was on connecting PHP to the MySQL database that was created in Week 8, and then dynamically generating web content.
        I learned how to open a connection using <code>mysqli</code> and execute queries using <code>$conn-&gt;query()</code>, then retrieve results with <code>fetch_assoc()</code>.
        I practised modularising the website using <code>PHP include</code> and applying existing CSS to PHP pages.
        We also learned how to construct a database connection script (<code>dbconn.php</code>) and use logic in PHP to generate customised output based on data values.
    </p>

    <h3>Tutorial Task</h3>
    <p>
        I began by inserting a number of records into the Participant table, including one for myself, through phpMyAdmin.
        After uploading the <code>dynamic_site</code> folder to the server, I edited <code>participants.php</code> to show the participant data from the MySQL database.
        Using a ternary operator, the experience column was formatted as “Yes” or “No”, with “Yes” being shown in bold.
        By copying existing images and styles folders from previous tutorials, the previous styling was applied automatically.
        I proceeded to create a hover effect for the table rows by assigning a class to the table and targeting it in CSS.
        I created new reusable PHP files for the header, nav, and footer components and included them in the page.
        I attempted the optional nav logic challenge but decided to skip it after finding it too difficult.
    </p>

    <h3>Self-Assessment and Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        This week really demonstrates connections between the front end and back end of a website.
        It was quite satisfying to see data being pulled from a database and displayed on the page.
        I noticed that using PHP includes makes the page structure feel more organised and easier to manage, which is particularly apparent when reusing elements like headers and footers.
        Even though I ended up skipping the optional navigation challenge, I still feel I got a lot out of working with dynamic content and using PHP to manage page structure.
        The hover effect and styling were interesting too, and also helped bring it all together visually.
    </p>

    <h2 id="week11">Week 11 Security</h2>

    <h3>Summary of New Skills</h3>
    <p>
        This week focused on implementing dynamic forms using PHP and the MySQL database.
        I was taught two common methods for handling user input: a two-file approach that includes an HTML and PHP file, and the self-posting PHP form, which is a single PHP file.
        I saw how insert and update queries can be used within PHP to update tables in the database and how to use HTML5 validation to ensure fields were completed correctly.
        The tutorial also introduced basic security practices like sanitising output using <code>htmlspecialchars()</code> to prevent cross-site scripting.
    </p>

    <h3>Tutorial Task</h3>
    <p>
        The tutorial involved updating the <code>add.html</code> form to include validation and post to <code>add.php</code>.
        In <code>add.php</code>, I wrote a statement to insert a new participant record into the database and then redirect back to <code>participants.php</code> if successful.
        I completed <code>edit.php</code> by writing a <code>retrieve()</code> function that will populate the form with the existing participant's data, and an <code>update()</code> one to commit the changes.
        I tested the forms to confirm participants could be added and edited successfully.
    </p>

    <h3>Self-Assessment and Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        Introducing dynamic user input felt like it built well on last week's content.
        The two-file approach in the tutorial for adding records was easy enough, but the edit page stood out to me more, seeing how one file can handle both displaying and updating a record depending on whether it's accessed via GET or POST.
        I also ran into a few minor issues like mistyped column names and simple CSS issues, which serve as my daily reminder that any tiny oversight can break functionality.
        I wouldn’t say the form logic was overly difficult, but I found it did reinforce the importance of sanitising data and the use of prepared statements.
        Overall, it feels like a complete ‘start to end’ proof from user input to database storage and retrieval.
    </p>

    <h2 id="week12">Week 12 Authentication</h2>

    <h3>Summary of New Skills</h3>
    <p>
        This week, I learned how to implement basic authentication and authorisation in PHP.
        I learned how we can use PHP sessions to persist login state across multiple pages and how we can verify a user’s identity through secure login forms.
        The lecture emphasised the ‘stateless’ nature of HTTP, the use of sessions to store state data, like logged-in users, and the importance of password hashing.
        PHP’s <code>password_hash()</code> and <code>password_verify()</code> functions were presented as secure tools to use when storing and validating passwords.
        The distinction between authentication (verification of identity) and authorisation (controlling access) was also covered.
    </p>

    <h3>Tutorial Task</h3>
    <p>
        The tutorial task went over implementing login and logout functionality.
        Using <code>session_start()</code> and <code>$_SESSION</code> to manage the user session ensured protected pages could only be accessed by a logged-in user.
        The login form was created as a self-posting PHP page and initially allowed any credentials to be entered.
        Later, I added a <code>User</code> table to the database that stores hashed passwords with <code>password_hash()</code> and verified them using <code>password_verify()</code> inside a function called <code>authenticate()</code>.
        I also made a form to register new users and implemented access control with session checks on the protected pages.
    </p>

    <h3>Self-Assessment and Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        This week's content was the final part tying together frontend forms, backend logic, and database operations.
        It increased my understanding of how authentication can be implemented on the web, in particular the importance of hashing and the role of sessions in state management.
        Having to add actual authorisation checks (redirection of unauthorised users) made the site feel like a real admin system.
        Overall, I feel I now have a clearer picture of secure user management in PHP.
    </p>

    <h2 id="assignment2">Assignment 2 Reflection: Blog Backend Development</h2>
    <p>
        Assignment 2 was quite a different type of challenge when compared to the frontend-focused first assignment.
        This time the focus was on the backend, which involved working with PHP, MySQL, and session handling.
        One of the most interesting aspects was seeing how the individual components (users, posts, tags, ratings, comments)
        all connected together through a database.
    </p>
    <p>
        A major learning point and a cause for some frustration for me was understanding how PHP and SQL queries work together
        to retrieve and display content dynamically. I encountered plenty of frustrating bugs, particularly around the search
        functionality, comment display, and database constraints like foreign keys. But getting everything working together
        properly in the end was very satisfying, and I feel like it helped me build confidence in backend development.
        Compared to frontend work, debugging on the backend felt more technical—more like problem solving with systems and data
        rather than layout and visual issues—and it was really rewarding when it all came together.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, this assignment solidified my learning during the semester and helped me understand the full stack of web
        development better. I can really appreciate how the backend enables dynamic functionality and controls access behind
        the scenes. Combining it with the frontend build earlier really conveyed the idea of a fully functioning website.
        Working as a team had its benefits and challenges, as it always does, but I felt that we shared responsibility well,
        and communication was excellent, and that meant we had no real overlap or conflict.
        It's great having a team to lean on when debugging or when planning and implementing new features.
        It was very satisfying to see everything come together and result in a cohesive product.
    </p>
